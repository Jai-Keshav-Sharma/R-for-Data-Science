# NOTE :------->
# The datasauRus package in R is designed to demonstrate the importance of visualizing data rather than relying solely on summary statistics. It includes datasets that highlight how drastically different data distributions can have identical statistical properties â€” a concept inspired by Anscombe's Quartet and enhanced with creative data patterns.

# Key Features of datasauRus
# Contains 13 datasets (referred to as the Datasaurus Dozen), each with the same mean, standard deviation, and correlation values but vastly different visual patterns.
# Excellent for teaching data visualization and emphasizing the risks of relying solely on summary statistics.
